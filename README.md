Khan academy exercises used the MobileCSP course.

These exercises were downloaded from Khan Academy.  They were originally embedded into Google Course Builder by Pavel Simikov in 2013. They were subsequently used in the MobileCSP course when it was hosted on GCB. They are embedded now, with minor changes, in the MobileCSP course on Runestone Interactive.
